React JSX Practice and Event Handling

Step One: Create a new simple react application

    Create a new directory to place today's work
    Create an HTML5 index.html file
    Bring in references to Bootstrap
    Bring in references to React and ReactDOM
    Bring in references to Babel
    Create a root DIV element

Step Two: Create a new Github Repository and use Git to create a local repository that syncs with your Github repository

    git init - THIS IS ONLY DONE ONCE PER REPOSITORY - YOU NEVER RUN THIS AGAIN
    git add -A - adds the files in this directory 
    git commit -m "a useful message describing this update here" - you do this every time you create a new update
    Create a github repository
    copy the git remote command there
    git push -u origin master - Push to the github repository

Step Three: Create a simple JSX form

    Create an input for an email
    Create an input for a password
    Create a button for submission

Step Four: Introduce an Event handler

    Create an event handlers for:
        The email input
        The password input
        The button
    Validate form input
        ensure the email is correct
        check to see that the password is 8 characters or more and has at least 1 number and one capitalized letter
    Show form input in a separate div:
        show the results from the form as JSX output in a separate DIV
